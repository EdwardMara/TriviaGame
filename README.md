# TriviaGame
This is a Star Trek themed trivia game with multiple choice options.

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

<h3>Notes</h3>
Initially had separate arrays for questions, answers, and choices. Each question is built as an object with a question that is displayed on the screen, an array of answers which are displayed through multiple choice buttons, and an integer that is the index position for the correct answer in the array.
